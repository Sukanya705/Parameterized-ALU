# Parameterized-ALU-in-Verilog

##  Overview
This project implements a parameterized Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL.
The ALU supports basic arithmetic and logical operations and can be configured for
different data widths using parameters.

##  Features
- Parameterized data width
- Supports arithmetic and logical operations
- Modular and synthesizable RTL design
- Separate testbench for verification

##  Operations Supported
|000 | ADD |
|001 | SUB |
|010 | AND |
|011 | OR  |
|100 | XOR |

##  Folder Structure
rtl/ : ALU RTL design files  
tb/  : Testbench files  

##  How to Simulate
This design was simulated using EDA Playground (online simulator).
Steps:
1. Upload RTL and testbench files
2. Select any Verilog simulator
3. Run simulation and observe output
   
## status
This project was built as part of my self-learning in RTL design.
